      I'm an early career researcher modelling ecosystem services. I have a MSci degree in Biodiversity and Conservation from University College London, and an interest in the interactions between humans and ecosystems. I'm currently working as a spatial scientist with [Natural Capital Research](https://www.natcapresearch.com/) in London modelling ecosystem services to help incorporate nature dependency into the global financial system.

          I was part of the Nature Engine team at Natcap, where I built models and metrics for double materiality analysis of agriculture and biodiversity and ecosystems. These models and metrics were core parts of the nature impact reporting product for compliance with the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), the Taskforce for Nature related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), and Science Based Targets Network (SBTN).

          I developed metrics and methods for:
          - Land use change
          - Habitat fragmentation
          - Remote sensing of land impact
          - Value chain analysis of nature impact

          I was part of a large team effort to produce high-resolution, 1km<sup>2</sup> maps of biodiversity across North America for over 4000 species, including mammals, reptiles, amphibians, ants, butterflies and dragonflies.
          These maps will be used to inform US governmental conservation strategies as part of the 30 by 30 project.

          - Contributed additions to the modelling workflow
          - Helped containerise the workflow using Docker
          - Massively parallelised the workflow using Slurm and Microsoft Azure to run models for hundreds of species at once
          - Also member of the centre seminar committee
